      <p class="lead">Over the course of three years, I developed a respiratory model for Etiometry Inc to be used as their second real-time patient risk index. The model is comprised of multiple dynamic equations that help track the flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide throughout the body. The model was then used along with a probalistic engine that combined real-time measurements to find the maximum likliehood of various states. Doing so, we are able to track many unmeasureable states and accurately track blood gases of a patient before a blood gas. The index was a likelihood estimation of how underventilated a mechanically-ventilated patient was based on the estimated oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. Really cool stuff, check out <a href=http://www.etiometry.com>Etiometry</a>. Along with model/algorithm development, I trained doctors, nurses and, respiratory therapists how to use the product.</p>

      <p class="lead">Intrigued by the use cases of blockchain technologies and what they can offer I began develop a personal project that allows graphic designers and digital artists to sell their digital artwork in a limited quantity. Blockchain technology has allowed for the creation of digitally rare items. Bitcoin a clear example and cryptopunks an example in tradeable rare artwork on the blockchain. This project will allow any artists to submit artwork and select how many will be produced and sold. This would allow the a digital artist to sell artwork as if it was a painting on a canvas.</p>
