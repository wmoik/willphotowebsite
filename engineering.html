    <b>Etiometry Inc</b><br>
    <res>Research Engineer II (Feb 2014 - Mar 2017)</res><br>
    <res>Over the course of three years, I developed a respiratory model for Etiometry Inc to be used as their second real time patient risk index. The model is made of multiple integrated dynamic equations that help track the flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide through the body. The model was then used along with a probalistic engine that combined real-time measurements with the model to find the maximum likliehood of each state. Doing so, we were able to track many unseen variables and more accurate track blood gases of the patient at any point in time before a blood draw. The index was likelihood estimation of how underventilated a mechanically patient was based on tracking of carbon dioxide levels. Really cool stuff, check out Etiometry. Along with model/algorithm development, I trained doctors, nurses and respiratory therapists on the product and in use of the algorithms.</res>

    <b>Sensory Substitution Device for the Visually Impaired</b><br>
    <res>Senior Capstone Project (Sept 2013 - May 2014)</res><br>
    <res>Rapid Prototyped a sensory subsitution device for the visually impaired that would detect dropoffs and hanging objects in from of the user that go undetected by a white cane. Worked with Boston University professor to conceptualize idea, then began breadboard, 3D printing, and testing. Received 2nd place for NIH DEBUT National competition.</res>

    <b>Boston University Visual Information Processing Lab</b><br>
    <res>Research Assistant (Jan 2013 - Sept 2013)</res><br>
    <res>As an undergraduate student at BU, I assisted Professor Konrad and Ishwar in the Visual Information Processing Lab. We were testing the viability of using gestures as biometric passwords to explore the possibility of combining revocable passwords (the gesture) with biometrics (the user's unique body structure). During testing, I tested the viability of the password system by generating "fake", synthetic, gestures to fool our own authentication system. The idea was to record a user performing their biometric gesture numerous times and from that, generated new, unrealized gestures that had the unique body structure of the user along with the intricacies of their password gesture.</res><br>
