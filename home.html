      <p class="lead">Over the course of three years, I developed a respiratory model for Etiometry Inc to be used as their second real time patient risk index. The model is made of multiple integrated dynamic equations that help track the flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide through the body. The model was then used along with a probalistic engine that combined real-time measurements with the model to find the maximum likliehood of each state. Doing so, we were able to track many unseen variables and accurately track blood gases of the patient before a blood draw. The index was likelihood estimation of how underventilated a mechanically patient was based on tracking of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. Really cool stuff, check out <a href=www.etiometry.com>Etiometry</a>. Along with model/algorithm development, I trained doctors, nurses and respiratory therapists how to use the product and algorithms.</p>

      <p class="lead">Developing a personal project that allows graphic designers and digital artists sell their digital artwork in a limited quantity. The blockchain revolution can lead to the value of rare diigtal art/coins. Bitcoin a clear example and cryptopunks a proven example in tradeable rare artwork on the blockchain. My project will allow anyone to submit artwork and select how many will be produced and sold.</p>

      Check out my sites (including this one)! Also had fun making a frogger web app for OO practice.</p>
